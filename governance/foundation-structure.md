# .NET Foundation Structure

The .NET Foundation is a non-profit 501.(c)(6) organization supporting it's members.
The Board of Directors of the .NET Foundation vote on any changes to the by-laws of the
organization and also get the final vote on accepting new projects. Most of the hard work
is done by the projects in the .NET Foundation, and they get a lot of control over how
they want to operate. However the following groups help run the general business of the 
.NET Foundation day-to-day as volunteers:

 - **[Board of Directors](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about#team)** - Made up of Member nominated individuals along with a director
   elected to represent the interests of the general .NET Community, the Board of Directors
   are responsible for the management and oversight of the business and affairs of the
   .NET Foundation. They have the final say about setting .NET Foundation by-laws and 
   accepting new projects based on the recommendations of the officers, advisory council
   and technical steering group. The full details of the roles and responsibilities of the directors
   are described in the .NET Foundation 
   [Articles of Incorporation](https://dnfwebsitewusproduction.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Documents/NET%20Foundation%20Articles%20of%20Incorporation.pdf)

   the .NET open source community. The council are made up of 9 individuals drawn from across the
   .NET Community (where no-one company can employ a majority of council members). 
 - **Technical Steering Group** - A working group of committers working on the core .NET projects to 
   help co-ordinate how technical decisions are made and communicated between those projects. In addition
   to the core contributors to the projects, the Board of Directors may also nominate representatives
   from corporate entities who are actively contributing to the .NET development platform ecosystem. 
 - **Project Leaders** - Each project in the .NET Foundation has a nominated leader or leaders that
   represent the project to the .NET Foundation and are empowered to make decisions for the project
   on behalf of that project's community.  
 - **Members** - Companies and organizations may be invited to join the .NET Foundation if they are
   actively contributing to the development of the open source .NET ecosystem and are prepared to
   contribute to the running of the .NET Foundation. The members of the .NET Foundation decide
   who the board members are that control the strategic direction of the foundation. 
 - **You** - Your contribution to both the individual projects in the .NET Foundation and also by
   supporting open source .NET in general is essential to the community. Please 
   [get involved](https://dotnetfoundation.org/get-involved) in any way that you can.
