# Entity Framework

[Entity Framework] is the recommend data access technology for new applications in .NET. It is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

Entity Framework has two versions: Entity Framework 6, for .NET Full Framework (Windows) and Entity Framework Core, for .NET Core. Both versions are open source.

[Entity Framework 6](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6) is the legacy Entity Framework for .NET Full Framework, that runs only under Windows Systems.

[Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) is the new version for .NET Core applications running Windows, Linux and MAC OS System. This version is being recreated, for better performance and portability.
