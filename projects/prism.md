# Prism

Prism is a framework for implementing maintainable, extensible, and testable XAML applications on WPF,  and Xamarin.Forms. Prism helps application developers implement multiple design patterns and principles including Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), Dependency Injection, Modularity, UI Composition, Commands, and PubSub Events. Prism was first developed by Microsoft patterns & practices and then transferred to the current Prism open source team in 2015.
